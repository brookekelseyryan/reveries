# Bedford Peak Hike

This was a nice 7.2 mile hike up to Bedford Peak in Silverado Canyon. It was rated as "hard" due to the 2200 feet in elevation gain.
Tyler and I wanted to do a local hike that didn't involve too much mileage for first venture back into hiking.
I couldn't find my Peak Design camera clip before we took off, so I had to keep my camera in my pack and I used it when
we took breaks, mostly at the top of the peak.

Overall, this was a lovely hike! I would really like to do some of the other peaks in the area.

## Editing
For editing these images, I typically started by comparing the RAW shot to the JPEG. If I was content with the JPEG,
I may have just added a light filter such as VSCO TRI-X preset on Lightroom. If I wasn't pleased with the JPEG, then I would edit more extensively
on the RAW image, altering exposure and such as needed. I would usually add one of the Fujifilm camera profiles in Lightroom (usually Astia soft). I played
around with different presets on these images. The effect is less cohesive, and consequently more "manufactured film"-ey look. In the future, I'd like to gravitate towards a certain filter
that is consistently used for the outing to give a film effect. I think I want to continue shooting in RAW+JPEG, honestly I don't
really see the downside (other than memory, but not an issue just yet).

For these images, I used Gold Soft 200 Hi (pink clouds picture), Royal 400 Warm+ (reddish Tyler picture), TRI-X, Fuji 400H, Fuji 800Z, Max 800 Warm + (Tyler sippy picture). I almost always added a grain effect.

I recently discovered [Fuji x weekly](https://fujixweekly.com/) which provides "recipes" for film simulations to put directly on your camera for JPEG processing.
I am eager to try these out, I tried to pay attention to which filters I tended to gravitate towards so I can decide which filters to save on my camera later on.
I also hope that this will make my editing process a bit more minimalistic in the future.

I struggled with the tradeoff of my desire for a pop of color and uniqueness versus an image being "too much." I feel like
sometimes minimalistic edits make me feel restricted, but too much filter is a bit nauseating and gives me 2009-era instagram
filter vibes. For instance, I think the picture with Tyler at the pole on the peak is a bit *too* red. It took a lot of restraint to not add
more red to the clouds picture, and in fact I think the resultant image may just be the JPEG taken straight from the camera.

Another thing I struggled with was this idea of preserving the "integrity" of the image, sometimes I wanted to honor
the settings and image I had captured and felt like I was defacing it by editing it too much.

Although the grain effect sometimes seemed also a bit "much", I really wanted to add it. Partially for the film effect,
and also because I recently learned I have something called Visual Snow Syndrome, which basically causes a grainy filter to be
cast over everything you see. I read that often people don't realize they have it until learning about the condition. I
like the idea of my images having a grain to match my internal experience. The film simulation is an added bonus.

### Favorite Images
I think my favorite pictures are the Tyler Sippy one and the pink clouds one. Although I only used the Gold Soft 200 Hi on that one
picture, it took my breath away a bit when I applied it. I was worried it was a bit "much" with the pinkness, but
it made the image look soo dreamy. I also applied the TRI-X one on top to give it that slightly desaturated effect, and then
applied some grain on top of it.

For the Typer Sippy image, I really like the subtle redness of the photo. I didn't really have to edit this RAW all too much.
