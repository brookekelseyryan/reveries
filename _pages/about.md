title: WTF*CK IS THIS
---

My name is Brooke K. Ryan.

This website was inspired by [Catherine Bui's journal](https://catherinebui.com/journal) which I found through [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/portfolio-sites). I love the concept of a personal page to share my photography or other miscellany---especially one that is not on social media.

So I made this page as a creative outlet to share my photos and whatnot. It also helps me keep track of the edits and pictures I liked throughout the year. I'm hoping it will inspire me to take more pictures.
